Welcome to the wav to flac converter!

To set your source/destination directories simply open config.json then type in the directories you want.

Whenever you're ready, select wav_to_flac_conversion.exe and let it run! 

You can run any amount of instances simultaneously, just change the source/destination as desired and run again.

copy_failures.csv is a log of failed copies, unless you want to do anything specific with it you can mostly just ignore it.
