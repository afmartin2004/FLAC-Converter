You'll need to download ffmpeg for the actual conversion to work. I've provided a .zip for the windows executable.

If that doesn't work/you're running a different OS, go to https://ffmpeg.org

Make sure to download your ffmpeg from "Get packages & executable files" - if you do "Download Source Code" you'll have to build it yourself.

Once downloaded, open your start menu and search for "Environment Variables". Then, click "Edit the system environment variables".

Next, click the "Environment Variables" button. Find the "Path" variable, then click edit (or double click).

Click "New", then add the path to the "bin" directory inside the ffmpeg folder

Click Ok until all the popdowns are gone

Open a cmd and type "ffmpeg -version" to verify your information

If you see version information, ffmpeg has been installed correctly
